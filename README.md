# Detection-covid19-ChestX
This project, built with Django, focuses on detecting COVID-19 from chest X-ray images using advanced Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). It employs three deep learning models—Xception, ResNet50, and VGG16—trained on the SARS-COV-2-Ct-Scan dataset, which includes X-ray images of patients diagnosed with COVID-19. The goal of the application is to provide a preliminary diagnostic tool that can quickly analyze chest X-rays and determine the likelihood of COVID-19 infection, offering an efficient and automated approach to pandemic-related challenges.

Users can upload X-ray images through a simple web interface. The system processes the images using the deep learning models and provides an output indicating whether the image likely represents a COVID-19 positive or negative case. This web-based application aims to assist healthcare providers in performing fast, early-stage diagnostic assessments.
